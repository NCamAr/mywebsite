					<h2>To My Muse</h2>
					<h3>2016</h3>
					<p>Because, Darling, I can’t forget you. Even though you have already forgotten me, I just can’t. For a muse to forget their artist is easier than the artist forgetting their muse, and that’s kind of the whole point, isn’t it? Be able to forget myself so I can always remember you.</p>

					<p>So, when you ask me to forget you is like asking to walk through fire without burning my skin or swim in the ocean without getting wet. I can’t, and I won’t, for your voice is as beautiful as the music I’m listening to, your body and your eyes as warm and bright as the candle beside me, and while I’m holding my pen, I wish for this to be your hand, and while the pen is going through the paper, I wish for it to be my hand going through your hair.</p>

					<p>But my love, be aware of something: I do not miss you, I can’t. For the one I miss is my muse you used to be and not the narcissist you are now. Be aware that the people you are giving yourself to don’t see you as their muse, they can’t. For you can be someone’s muse once, and you’ve already been mine.</p> 

					<p>Be aware my love, be aware that if you ever decide to come back, you can’t. For you cry over a dead body only once and the memory is the one that stays with you, but you do not hug that corpse, you do not hold its hand, you do not, my love, you do not love it again.</p>

					<p>	And, dearest, you are just another dead body in the morgue of muses.</p>

					<h2>To My Muse, Pt. 2</h2>
					<h3>2019</h3>
					<p>The last time I wrote you, I killed you. You were dead for both my eyes and my pages. Nothing more than a rotting corpse in my mind and a useless muse for my pen.</p>

					<p>Don’t get confused now my Darling, for the fact that I’m writing you right now does not mean you came back. Quite the contrary, knowing that you’re lying still somewhere underneath is a relieve, because that way you won’t answer me when I write you about them. </p>

					<p>You see my love, I’ve been killed. I’ve been cut open and killed. They warned me they were going to kill me and still I stayed. I stayed because when I saw them, I never saw my murderer, I just saw my inspiration. I never saw the knife, just the ink. Isn’t it ironic how after death, I still write about them? But I can’t help it, my love, I just can’t. I can’t help it because unlike you, they were the perfect muse. </p>

					<p>Their sole existence was more than enough for my paper, their laugh and their voice was the perfect music for my writing, and their body, god, their body was the perfect canvas any artist wish they could paint on. And I know I’m not the greatest, I know there are better ones out there, but for a moment, I was their artist. Me, out of everyone, me. For what felt like a second, I was the lucky bastard that got to appreciate them.</p>

					<p>And I tried, god I tried. I tried so hard to make them see themselves as the museum they are, for they had been told that they’re not worth exploring and knowing. And I wondered, how can someone say something like that? How can anybody lie in such ways? Because their eyes alone are two different galaxies that everyone deserves to get lost in at least once. </p>

					<p>Now my love, don’t let me fool you. I told you they were the perfect muse, but they are far from perfect. They have flaws, more than a few, some bigger than others, just like any other human being, but I’m not going to write about them. I won’t because you don’t deserve to know them. I won’t because they never bothered me. But mainly, I won’t because when it comes to their flaws, these are just pieces of the mosaic, not the whole picture. </p>

					<p>So Darling, I’ve been killed. If you had some kind of vendetta against me, be happy, for I’ve been killed in the ugliest way possible by the most beautiful murderer. But what makes this worst, what you can laugh at all the way in your tomb, it’s that I’m still theirs. I’m completely theirs. Every part of me, including my pen, belongs to them. And I think it always will. Yes, maybe in the future it won’t mean the same, maybe I’ll stop the tears and the songs, maybe I’ll start sleeping and smiling, maybe I’ll just forget about them entirely. </p>

					<p>Yet for now, they own me. Don’t forget that when I’m buried next to you. My used and wasted body, although next to yours, doesn’t belong to you or to me or the earth for that matter. It belongs to someone out there, who’s all too busy looking for their next victim to be grieving their last.

					<h2>To My Muse, Pt.3</h2>
					<h3>2020</h3>
					<p>Someone asked me why I haven’t been writing lately. I honestly didn’t know why, I can imagine the words, the sentences, I can see them in a paper but the moment I take the pen, my mind goes completely blank, and then, while watching this damn movie and thinking about yesterday, I understood. I haven’t been writing because I need someone to write to.</p>

					<p>And that’s why I’m here, once again, writing you. For someone who constantly says that you’re dead, I seem to bring you back to life a lot</p>
						. 
					<p>A lot has happened since the last time I wrote. I kept on being sad but then things changed and I felt happy, genuinely happy, something I hadn’t felt for a while. Things weren’t like before but I didn’t mind that, actually, I was kind of happy thing weren’t like before because they were better.</p>

					<p>Now, while things were changing around me, I was changing within myself at the same time, however, I feel like the process just stopped. Not really sure when but I know it never continued. Thing is, I look at myself in the mirror and I don’t know what or who I see. Do I see myself? Do I see my body? Do I see who I want to be or who I’m supposed to be? Do I see a designer? A friend? A sister? Who is that person that reflects back to me? </p>

					<p>And that makes me wonder, who was the person you saw back then when you used to look at me. Did you see your artist or did you see your object? Maybe if you tell me who I used to be, I can finally figure out who I am right now. Maybe I can finally complete this damn puzzle that I’m stuck at. Perhaps you’re the missing piece, or perhaps there are no missing pieces and I’m forcing myself to complete something that’s already whole.</p>

					<p>It’s funny how I say that yet I can’t seem to convince myself of it. You see, I’ve loved people the way I should love myself. Correction, I love people the way I should love myself, with such intensity to the point that I don’t think I’ll be able to handle it. I look at them and I believe the person I am right now doesn’t deserve them, I don’t belong in their lives. Maybe at some point I did but right now? I don’t really belong anywhere. </p>

					<p>Darling, I used to belong to you, but you died and you took a part of me with you. Then I belonged to them, they killed me and they took another part of me with them. Now here I am, thinking how am I going to fill these holes that seem to grow bigger and bigger every day. Is it family? Friends? Maybe a diploma? </p>

					<p>Tell me, my love, is the puzzle complete or am I missing something? Does it have an owner, more than one or is it hidden in a closet collecting dust? I’d like to think you know the answers, because otherwise, I’d have no one left to ask. And if I have no one left, that means I was never stuck, the process did finish and the one I see in the mirror is not who I want to be nor who I’m supposed to. It’s who I am, who I have been for a while now, a complete stranger.

					<p>Yet, still have hope. I’m hoping for at least just one time. I’m hopelessly hoping for just one time. I don’t care if it’s a dare or something that was born from you. Just tell me and do it. Let me taste them. </p>

					<p>Though I won’t be forever -You don’t want me to be-, I can still be a story. An experience. A little change. Or just whatever you want me to be, but let me be something. Otherwise, my heart won’t stop telling my brain to go somewhere else with you. </p>

					<p>So, at least do it from my sanity, or else, I will go crazy. And not for you, but because of you. And that’s worse. Oh, so much worse. And I swear to you, I want to be better, and my heart will feel in peace, for I’ll finally be worth it.</p>

					<p>I know I will.</p>

					<p>I must be. </p>

					<p>I’m cold. <br>
						I’m cold and it’s stupid because it’s almost winter. <br>

						I’m shaking every once in a while. <br>

					<p>Thing is, they were cold too. <br>

						Only problem it’s that it wasn’t almost winter. <br>
						No, in fact, summer just ended. <br>
						And still, they were staying in bed longer. <br>
						They were shaking every once in a while. <br>
						They were taking longer showers under the hot water. <br>
					So, they were cold too. </p>

					<p>I wasn’t feeling cold back then <br>
						I mean, it was summer, so I couldn’t, right? <br>
						But I knew they were cold. <br>
						So, I held them. I fucking held them. <br>
						Was that stupid? To do it? <br>
						It’s not like they thought I was going to be cold. <br>
						Hell, no one thought about that. Not even me. <br>
					And it was stupid because, well, it’s almost winter. </p>

					<p>And I’m tired of being cold. <br>
						And even more tired of being cold and not held. <br>

						Whatever it is. <br>
					I’m cold. </p>

					<h2>Your Name</h2>
					<h3>2020</h3>
					<p>I’ve read stories about how names have power, how they can be the solution to a problem or the start of one. There’s a reason why people spend so much time picking them.</p>

					<p>I used to be a slave to your name. I would see it and no matter what, my mind would turn off and I would cease to understand logic. And my heart? God, my heart used to take this chance to leave my rib cage and run to the hands he was referring to as a home. Your name had become a prayer, and I would pray every single night to the point that the sky was tired of hearing it.</p>

					<p>Sadly, I ended up wasting your name, I wasted it so much that now I can’t even see a word, they are just letters, put together for my eyes to read. Nonetheless, I keep saying it out loud for the world to hear, as fucked up as that is, I keep forcing my mouth to pronounce the meaningless letters, hoping that one day my heart wakes up, because right now it’s not moving, it’s not breathing, it’s not doing anything besides pumping blood, making it useless. Why do I need it if it’s just going to be there? Quiet and still? </p>

					<p>My brain on the other hand likes this, he’s thrilled to be finally free of the chains that your name used to come with. However, he does miss the feeling of death, the feeling of pitch black, because it was in those moments, when there was nothing but darkness, that all of the thoughts and images that haunt him on the daily would finally disappear.</p>

					<p>Your name was both my saviour and my enemy, my black and my white, my day and night, my ev-erything and my nothing, my reason to smile and my reason to cry.</p>

					<p>It wasn’t until two days ago, after all this pain and comfort, when I started wondering if you knew my name. If you even took the time to learn it.</p>

					<p>Names have power, that’s a fact, but it’s us that unlock it. It’s us that, when given the opportunity, let us destroy us.</p>

					<p>And I know this now because otherwise, you would have learned my name.</p>

					<p>And I would have forgotten yours.</p>
